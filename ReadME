# Customer Churn Prediction System

This project is a Customer Churn Prediction System developed for a bank. It uses machine learning to predict whether a customer is likely to leave the bank (churn) or stay based on their historical data. The project leverages several libraries, including NumPy, TensorFlow, scikit-learn, Keras, and Matplotlib.

## Introduction

Customer churn is a critical issue for many businesses, including banks. By predicting which customers are at risk of leaving, banks can take proactive measures to retain them. This system uses machine learning algorithms to analyze customer data and predict churn.

## Features

- Data preprocessing and cleaning
- Feature engineering and selection
- Model training and evaluation
- Visualization of results
- Predicting customer churn

## Data

The dataset used for this project contains information about bank customers, including their demographic details, account information, and transaction history. The data is preprocessed and split into training and testing sets for model evaluation.

## Installation

To install the necessary dependencies, run the following command:

```bash
pip install numpy tensorflow scikit-learn keras matplotlib
